# Simple Resource Gatherer #

## Basic Idea ##

3D Game, either static orthogonal camera angle, follow behind, or RS style.

Main mechanic is gathering resources (woodcutting, mining, etc)

Resources can be used for upgrades that facilitate the resource gathering process?
  - Gather resources faster
  - Hold more resources

Game structure TBD, I'm thinking some sort of of round where you need to get X amounts
of each resource or something. The challenge should be how to spend your time and manage
your resources

## TODO ##

### Player ###

 - [X] Find some free assets for the player
 - [X] Implement basic movement controls
 - [X] Set up orthogonal camera
 - [X] Add walking animation
 - [X] Switch to click-to-walk / pathfinding

### UI ###

 - [ ] Clean up code
 - [ ] Add a click animation
 - [X] Add a custom mouse

### Basic Gameplay ###

 - [ ] 3D Tilemaps?
 - [ ] Add some tree sprites
 - [ ] Create some collision logic if player does woodcutting action next to tree
 - [ ] Give the tree a "health bar" and have it decrease when it's being chopped
 - [ ] Switch to a tree stump sprite once the tree's life hits 0
 - [ ] Regenerate the tree after X seconds
 - [ ] Create a basic HUD with a wood icon and quantity
 - [ ] Add wood to your resources when you cut a tree down

### Bugs ###

 - [ ] Clicking on player directly causes them to face up


### Other ###
