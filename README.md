# Simple Resource Gatherer #

## Basic Idea ##

3D Game, either static orthogonal camera angle, follow behind, or RS style.

Main mechanic is gathering resources (woodcutting, mining, etc)

Resources can be used for upgrades that facilitate the resource gathering process?
  - Gather resources faster
  - Hold more resources

Game structure TBD, I'm thinking some sort of of round where you need to get X amounts
of each resource or something. The challenge should be how to spend your time and manage
your resources

## TODO ##

 - [ ] Implement some sort of movement
